<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-12">Hello everyone, I’m <strong class="text-blue-600">Isaac Talb</strong>. If you’re starting your development journey in 2026, you’re entering a <strong class="text-blue-600">rapidly evolving landscape</strong>. Here’s the advice I wish someone gave me when I started.</p>

<hr>
&nbsp; 

## <span class="text-2xl font-semibold">Master the Fundamentals First</span>
<br>

New tools and frameworks appear daily. AI can generate code. But <strong>fundamentals never go out of style</strong>:

- **Data structures & algorithms** → They’re not just for interviews
- **System design** → Understanding how pieces fit together
- **Computer science basics** → Networks, databases, operating systems
- **Problem-solving mindset** → Break complex problems into smaller ones

AI can write code, but it can’t replace your understanding of <em>why</em> the code works.

&nbsp;

## <span class="text-2xl font-semibold">Build Projects, Not Just Tutorials</span>
<br>

Tutorials give you the illusion of progress. Building projects gives you actual skills:

1. **Start small** → A todo app, a simple API, a basic website
2. **Add complexity** → Authentication, database, deployment
3. **Ship it** → Put it online, let people use it
4. **Reflect** → What worked? What didn’t? Document your learnings

**The gap between "tutorial developer" and "real developer" is filled with shipped projects.**

&nbsp;

## <span class="text-2xl font-semibold">Learn to Learn</span>
<br>

The half-life of technical knowledge is shorter than ever:

- Pick up new languages when needed—don’t chase every trend
- Read documentation before watching tutorials
- Join open-source projects to see real-world code
- Teach others—it forces you to understand deeply

&nbsp;

## <span class="text-2xl font-semibold">Soft Skills Matter More Than You Think</span>
<br>

Technical skills get you hired. Soft skills get you promoted:

- **Communication** → Explain technical concepts to non-technical people
- **Collaboration** → Code reviews, pair programming, team discussions
- **Empathy** → Understand user needs and teammate perspectives
- **Adaptability** → The tech that’s hot today might be obsolete tomorrow

&nbsp;

## <span class="text-2xl font-semibold">Use AI as a Tool, Not a Crutch</span>
<br>

AI coding assistants are powerful but dangerous if misused:

✅ **Good:** Use AI for boilerplate, quick lookups, exploring solutions  
❌ **Bad:** Copy-paste without understanding, rely on AI for everything

**Remember:** Your job isn’t to write code—it’s to solve problems. AI helps with syntax; you handle the thinking.

&nbsp;

## <span class="text-2xl font-semibold">Take Care of Yourself</span>
<br>

Burnout is real in tech:

- Set boundaries—especially when working remotely
- Take breaks—step away from the screen
- Sleep matters—cognitive function degrades without rest
- It’s okay to say no—protect your time

&nbsp;

## <span class="text-2xl font-semibold">Closing</span>

The path isn’t linear. You’ll face imposter syndrome, failed interviews, and projects that break at 3 AM. <strong>That’s the job</strong>. Keep building, keep learning, and remember why you started.

You’ve got this. 🚀
