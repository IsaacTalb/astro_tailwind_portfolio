<h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-8">My First Portfolio Blog</h1>

<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-12">Hello everyone, Iâ€™m <strong class="text-blue-600">Isaac Talb</strong>. This is my very first blog post on my portfolio website, and Iâ€™d like to introduce how I built this project â€” so that <strong class="text-blue-600">newer developers</strong> can learn, copy, and apply it for their <strong class="text-blue-600">educational purposes</strong>.</p>

## <span class="text-2xl font-semibold">Project Stack</span>
<br>
For this site, I combined three powerful tools:

- **Astro** â†’ A modern static site builder, perfect for content-heavy sites.
- **Tailwind CSS** â†’ A utility-first CSS framework that keeps styling fast and consistent.
- **Markdown** â†’ Simple and developer-friendly for writing blog content.

This combination allows me (and you) to create a clean, fast, and easily maintainable portfolio website.

&nbsp;

## <span class="text-2xl font-semibold">Project Implementation</span>
<br>
Hereâ€™s a quick overview of how I set up this project:

1. **Created an Astro project** â†’ `npm create astro@latest my-portfolio`
2. **Integrated Tailwind CSS** â†’ followed Astroâ€™s official Tailwind integration guide.
3. **Configured Markdown support** â†’ blogs are written directly in `.md` files under `src/content/blog`.
4. **Used a layout component** â†’ every blog post uses a shared layout (`MainLayout.astro`).
5. **Deployed to GitHub Pages** â†’ free hosting for static sites.

With these steps, you can have a working personal portfolio and blogging system in no time.

## <span class="text-2xl font-semibold">Why Share This?</span>
<br>
I built this not just for myself, but also to inspire <b>newer developers</b> who want to learn how to:

- Build a simple yet professional portfolio.
- Write content in Markdown.
- Deploy projects publicly for free.

You are welcome to **copy this project structure** and modify it for your own learning. Please note this is meant for **educational purposes only**.

This is just the beginning.
In my **next blog post**, Iâ€™ll provide a more complete guide on **how to write Markdown content** so that anyone using this project can easily create their own posts.

For now, I hope this first post gives you a clear starting point. ðŸš€
