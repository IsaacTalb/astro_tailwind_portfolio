<p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-12">Hello everyone, I’m <strong class="text-blue-600">Isaac Talb</strong>. We’re living through one of the most <strong class="text-blue-600">transformative periods</strong> in technology. AI isn’t coming—it’s here. Let me share my thoughts on what this means for us.</p>

<hr>
&nbsp; 

## <span class="text-2xl font-semibold">We're Not Being Replaced—We're Being Augmented</span>
<br>

The fear that AI will replace developers is overblown. Here’s what’s actually happening:

- **Automation of repetitive tasks** → Boilerplate code, documentation, testing
- **Faster iteration** → Prototype in hours instead of days
- **Accessibility** → More people can build, raising the baseline

But <strong>creative problem solving, architectural decisions, and understanding user needs</strong>? That’s still human territory.

AI is your intern: helpful, fast, but needs supervision.

&nbsp;

## <span class="text-2xl font-semibold">The Bar is Rising</span>
<br>

What used to be impressive is now expected:

- **Before:** Building a simple website was a skill
- **Now:** Everyone can generate one; differentiation comes from thoughtful UX, performance, accessibility

This isn’t bad—it just means we need to level up. Focus on:

- System architecture and design
- Understanding trade-offs
- Business context and user empathy
- Security and ethical considerations

&nbsp;

## <span class="text-2xl font-semibold">The Dark Side We Must Address</span>
<br>

AI isn’t all progress:

- **Environmental cost** → Training models consumes massive energy
- **Bias amplification** → AI inherits and scales human prejudices
- **Job displacement** → Some roles genuinely at risk
- **Dependency risk** → What happens when AI services go down?

As builders, we have a responsibility to consider these impacts. <strong>Just because we can build it, doesn’t mean we should.</strong>

&nbsp;

## <span class="text-2xl font-semibold">What I'm Excited About</span>
<br>

Despite the concerns, there’s genuine progress:

- **Democratization of creation** → Individuals can build what once required teams
- **Accessibility improvements** → AI-powered tools helping people with disabilities
- **Scientific acceleration** → Drug discovery, climate modeling, space exploration
- **Education** → Personalized learning at scale

The potential is real. The question is whether we’ll steward it responsibly.

&nbsp;

## <span class="text-2xl font-semibold">My Prediction for 2026-2030</span>
<br>

Here’s what I think happens:

1. **AI becomes infrastructure** → Like electricity, it’s just there
2. **Prompt engineering fades** → Natural language interfaces improve to the point where "engineering" isn’t needed
3. **Creators thrive** → People who can define problems clearly and validate solutions
4. **Ethics becomes essential** → Not optional, not a nice-to-have
5. **Human connection increases in value** → As AI handles the mechanical, empathy differentiates

&nbsp;

## <span class="text-2xl font-semibold">How to Prepare</span>
<br>

- **Stay curious** → Follow AI developments, experiment with tools
- **Build judgment** → Learn to evaluate AI output critically
- **Focus on uniquely human skills** → Creativity, empathy, ethics, strategic thinking
- **Contribute to open source** → Help shape AI in directions that benefit everyone

&nbsp;

## <span class="text-2xl font-semibold">Closing</span>

The AI era isn’t something happening <em>to</em> us—it’s something we’re building together. We get to decide what kind of future we’re creating.

Let’s build one worth living in. 🌍
